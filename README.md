# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App project! This application was developed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information. By integrating weather data APIs from OpenWeatherMap, the app fetches and displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and more.

## Features

- **Weather Data Integration:** The app seamlessly integrates with OpenWeatherMap APIs to retrieve real-time weather data.
  
- **Responsive Design:** I've implemented responsive design principles to ensure that the app provides an optimal user experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for users to access weather information without any hassle.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the code with your actual API key.
4. Run the app locally or deploy it to a web server to start fetching and displaying weather information.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API
